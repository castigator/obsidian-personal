Hey my lovelies... I hope you festival guys are having fun :)

An update on movements: it looks like I've pulled the date on the new place forward, which means that, hopefully, I'll have it on 22nd August. Basically a week away...

The address, for your records is:

19 Westgate Street
Long Melford
Sudbury
Suffolk CO10 9DS

Hopefully, that will ease any awkwardness that my being in Pebmarsh causes.

I'll still be here for you - only a little further down the road. There'll be some to-ing and fro-ing as things get sorted...

When's your moving date, Daisy? Can you share the new address?
